            <h3>Current Schools Affairs</h3>
            <p>We are excited to announce our upcoming Graduation Ceremony, a special event to celebrate the hard work, achievements, and bright futures of our learners. Families and friends are warmly invited to join us in honoring this milestone as we prepare our students to step confidently into the next chapter of their journey. This day is more than just a celebration—it is a reflection of the growth, resilience, and determination that our students have shown throughout their academic journey.
                <br><br>
                At Lakewood Schools, graduation is a cherished tradition that marks the transition from one stage of learning to the next. It is a time to acknowledge not only academic accomplishments but also the personal growth and character development that our students have embraced. From the youngest learners completing early years to those stepping into junior and senior school, each graduate represents the success of our commitment to holistic education
                <br><br>
                This year's ceremony promises to be both memorable and inspiring. With performances, student reflections, and words of encouragement from our educators, the event will highlight the values that make Lakewood Schools a nurturing and empowering environment. We invite our school community to join us as we celebrate the achievements of our students and look forward with pride to the promising futures that lie ahead.
                <br><br>
                Graduation is also a time to look forward. For many of our students, it marks the beginning of a new academic journey—whether that be moving into the next level of the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), joining a Cambridge pathway, or stepping into secondary school. The ceremony reminds us that education is not only about what has been achieved but also about the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.
                <br><br>
                As we prepare for this special day, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to the parents, guardians, and the entire Lakewood community for their unwavering support. Together, we have created an environment where learners thrive, values are instilled, and lifelong friendships are formed. The Graduation Ceremony is not only a celebration of the students' success but also a recognition of the teamwork and unity that define Lakewood Schools
                <br><br>
                We warmly welcome all families and friends to join us for this milestone occasion. Let us celebrate the achievements of our students, honor their dedication, and encourage them as they step into their bright futures with confidence and hope. This will truly be a day to remember—a reflection of the timeless values and vision that guide Lakewood Schools.
